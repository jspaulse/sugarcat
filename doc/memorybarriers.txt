A Data Synchronization Barrier (DSB) completes when all instructions before this instruction complete.
A Data Memory Barrier (DMB) ensures that all explicit memory accesses before the DMB instruction complete before any explicit memory accesses after the DMB instruction start.
An Instruction Synchronization Barrier (ISB) flushes the pipeline in the processor, so that all instructions following the ISB are fetched from cache or memory, after the ISB has been completed.

Access to mmu tables should be followed with dsb (and flush)
Access to critical regions should start and end with dmb

"MMIO reads need to be performed in program order because they might have side effects on the device you are reading from. 
For example, if the device is streaming data, reading the value could cause the the device to replace it with a new value. 
It could also cause an action which may trigger a change at a different MMIO location. 
Therefore, reads to these two locations must be ordered, 
since the results depend on the order they are performed."
