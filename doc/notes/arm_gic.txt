GIC:
	Comprised of a distributor block and N CPU interface blocks
		Distributor:
			Performs interrupt prioritization & distrubtion to CPU interfaces
		CPU interfaces:
			Performs priority masking and preemption handling for processor
			
	Distributor:
		Provides an interface for:
			Globally enabling interrupt forwarding to CPU interfaces
			Enabling/Disabling each interrupt
			Setting Priority levels of each interrupt
			Setting target CPU list of each interrupt
			Sending SGI to CPUS
			State of each interrupt
			Setting/Clearing pending status of peripheral interrupt
			
	CPU interfaces:
		Provides an interface for:
			Enabling interrupts
			Acknowledging interrupts
			Indicating completion of interrupt
			Setting interrupt priority mask
			Defining preemption policy
			Determing highest priority pending interrupt
		Processor Interrupt Flow(?):
			Processor acknowledges an interrupt:
				by reading the CPU Interrupt Acknowledge register (ICCIAR)
				
	Four interrupt states:
		Inactive			An interrupt is not active or pending
		Pending				Interrupt that is waiting to be serviced by target processor
		Active				Interrupt that has been acknowledged by processor and is being serviced, not complete
		Active and Pending	Processor servicing interrupt and GIC has pending interrupt from same source
		
	Interrupt types:
		Private peripheral interrupt (PPI):
			Specific to a single processor
		Shared peripheral interrupt (SPI):
			Peripheral interrupt that Distributor can route to any processor
		Software generated interrupt (SGI):
			Interrupt generated by writing to specifc register in GIC
			Used for interprocessor communication
		Spurious Interrupt:
			When processor acknowledges interrupt that is spurious, GIC returns
			special interrupt ID (that is effectively spurious ID)
	Models for handling interrupts:
		1-N model:
			Only one processor handles interrupt.
		N-N model:
			All processors receive interrupt independently
			When a processor acknowledges interrupt, pending state
				is cleared for that processor, remains pending on
				all other processors.		
Interrupt IDs:
	Interrupt # ID32-1019 are SPI
	Interrupt # ID0-31 are private to CPU (BANKED)
		ID0-15 	are used for SGI
		ID16-31	are used for PPI
SGI:
	Each CPU issues SGI by writing to IDCSGIR in distributor (4.3.13 Software Generated Interrupt Register (ICDSGIR))
	Handled using the N-N model
