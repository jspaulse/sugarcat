For testing:
	Assume that all interrupts default to N-N; whichever processor gets there first gets it, all other spurious?

Learn about interrupt priorities (because I don't want to deal with them at the moment)

Do we want some kind of registration of kernel functions for specific arch./mach.?
	Probably not.

Bringing the other CPU's up?
A processor reads the ICCIAR and obtains the interrupt ID 1023, indicating a spurious interrupt.
Configuration Base Address Register:
	MRC p15,4,<Rd>,c15,c0,0; Read Configuration Base Address Register
	MCR p15,4,<Rd>,c15,c0,0; Write Configuration Base Address Register
	
Offsets from that base address:

Create a machine specific dir
	mach/xxx/layout.c
		Incorporate any necessary details (I.E., vector table)
	
IVT:
	arch/armv7/ivt/ivt.c
		install feature (lawl)
	arch/armv7/ivt/ivt.s
		asm level handlers
			parse out necessary deets
				branch into generic kernel handlers
				fix up necessary
				exit


Flow ->
