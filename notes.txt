Configuration
You configure the processor for low interrupt latency mode by use of the system control coprocessor. To ensure that a change between normal and low interrupt latency configurations is synchronized correctly, you must use software systems that only change the configuration while interrupts are disabled.
Exception processing enhancements
The ARMv6 architecture contains several enhancements to exception processing, to reduce interrupt handler entry and exit time:
SRS
Save return state to a specified stack frame.
RFE
Return from exception.
CPS
Directly modify the CPSR.
