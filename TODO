kernel:
    create a memory layout interface which (utilizing kernel.ld & the fdt)
    can provide a detai layout about where things are & where things are 
    allocated in memory.
    
    
Vexpress:
    Move all of the mmu init into kernel_init
mmu:
    Create functions for initializing/creating mmu_pgtbs
	All this requires is taking the kernel region, dividing
	    by page size (into page_cnt) & creating entry per
	    pg_cnt;
	
	    allocate space (1MiB above kernel, ALIGN_UP(1MiB Above kernel,
		arch_mmu_get_pgtb_align()));
	    arch_mmu_map_new(pgtbs, ...);
	    arch_mmu_map_new_pgtbs_pgdir(pgtbs, pgdir);
	keep track of this region, we'll need to pass to PMM
	    
	
Kernel:
    Map dis-continuous regions into memory
    
development flow (short term):
    spinlocks
    memory management:
	mmu
	    arch_mmu_interface
	vmm
	pmm
	heap
    mm_interface
    cpu_setup
	secondary_cpu_setup
Concept idea:
    For heap allocation (I.E., kmalloc, kfree)
	Have the heap descend downwards
	Put the heap at the top of memory
	    Should we pre allocate N number of virtual addresses?
	    
Concept idea:
    Wrap arch specific things! As an example, the mmu:
	mmu.c mmu_map(phy_page, virt_page, (DEVICE|CACHED), (KERNEL|USER))
	-> arch/armv7/mmu/armv7_arch_mmu.c -> arch_mmu_map(phy_page, virt_page)
	    -> arch/armv7/mmu/armv7_mmu.c -> armv7_mmu_map_pgtb(struct ...)
    So, anything that ends up being arch. specific will be required to provide an arch interface.

vexpress_init.c
    install_ivt()	- remove
    Fixup domain access
    Fixup region access (AP)
    
    init_mmu_entry
	flags doesn't make sense
	    it changes between different entries
	init_setup_kern_pgtb
	init_map_kern_pgtb
    armv7_mmu_set_kern_pgd(..)
	actually use flags

armv7_mmu.c/h (armv7_arch_mmu.c)
    introduce caching flags and all that jazzery.
    entry type support
	maybe move that to some sort of configuration?
	
Look at enabling all of the necessary caches and all that jazz.

Concept idea:
	When mapping phy->vm for i/o, keep track of requested regions (i.e., counter)
		so, if dev A&B need region X
			A-> mm_io_request_reg(X) creates a tracked entry (counter + 1) and returns a ptr
				(pointer returned is added for register use? since we're allocating pages)
			B-> mm_io_request_reg(X) returns the same ptr (added, of course)
			
		when a device no longer needs the region
			A-> mm_io_free_reg(X) decrements counter, if counter == 0 free, otherwise don't

kinit/kinit_warn/panic
	Garbage functions, need better.
	panic should probably dump more

mm (Memory Manager)
    Oversees PMM, VMM and heap functions (kmalloc, kfree)
pmm (Physical Memory Manager):
    Handles allocation (and book keeping) of physical pages
	No Access outside of VMM
vmm (Virtual Memory Manager):
    Handles allocation of pages & iomapping
	(Probably no access outside of indirect access via mm)
		
Flow:
    vexpress_init
	branch into kernel init (pass kernel phy info, not ss though)
	    config base will need to evolve to whatever in high mem
		or, make sure it gets mapped and phy_to_virt() that shiz.

    kernel_init
	require 1:1 map of phy mem in lower table && kmphy->kmvirt
	    init pmm
		gets memory region - start & size
		    mark book keeping regions used
		    mark kernel regions used
	    init mmu
		in our case, requires 2MB continuous (or, 512 pages)
		map 2MB continuous in mmu
		do actual kernel mappings
	    init vmm
		    whatever that'll involve
	    init cpu (for reals)
		allocate pages for various stacks
	    init secondary cpu's
		allocate pages for various stacks, set mmu ttb1 to kern ttb1
